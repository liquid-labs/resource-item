  Item
    ✓ Trying to create an Item directl ('new Item(data)') raises an exception (10 ms)
    ✓ Trying to define an item without a specified 'keyField' results in a error
    ✓ creating an item instance without a "truthy" keyField value results in an error (1 ms)
    subclasses
      ✓ defers to override getters/setters
      ✓ can call subclass functions
      ✓ subclass getters are 'in' instances; e.g.: '"bar" in subItem' -> true
      ✓ data keys show up as enumerable; e.g. 'Object.subItem(keys) = array, id, integer, object, string'
      constructor
        ✓ SubItem has protoype [object Object] (1 ms)
      get
        ✓ item.string -> $p
        ✓ item.integer -> $p
        ✓ will return distinct, equivalent object values (1 ms)
        ✓ will return distinct, equivalent array values
        ✓ will map the 'id' property
        ✓ .data -> a copy of the data
      set operations
        ✓ are not permitted on unknown properties
        ✓ by default are not permitted on known properties (1 ms)
        ✓ succeed when explicitly allowed
      private fields
        ✓ works with private value fields
        ✓ works with private object fields
        ✓ works with indirect private access (1 ms)
    sub-subclasses
      ✓ can call subclass functions
      ✓ can call sub-sublass functions
      constructor
        ✓ SubSubItem has protoype [object Object]
      get
        ✓ item.string -> $p
        ✓ item.integer -> $p (1 ms)
        ✓ will return distinct, equivalent object values
        ✓ will return distinct, equivalent array values
        ✓ will map the 'id' property
        ✓ .data -> a copy of the data

      private fields
        ✓ works with private value fields
        ✓ works with private object fields
        ✓ works with indirect private access (1 ms)
    getWatchers
      ✓ are invoked on any get operation
      ✓ can cancel actions by throwing an error
    setWatchers
      ✓ are invoked on any set operation (1 ms)
      ✓ can cancel actions by throwing an error
